## preface
* goals of this workshop
    * introduction to encoding formats: DER, hex, sha256, ripemd160, base64, base58
    * understanding of bouncy castle lib
        * generating elliptic curve key pair
        * deriving public key from private key
        * entities: SECObjectIdentifiers, ECDomainParameters, ECNamedDomainParameters
    * understanding how bitcoin address is created from public key
    * can explain elliptic curve domain parameters

## formats
* DER
    * is a binary format for data structures described by ASN.1
    * used as the most popular encoding format to store X.509 certificates in files
    * basic rule: all data types shall be encoded as four components in the following order:
        * Identifier octets
        * Length octets
        * Contents octets
        * End-of-contents octets
    * exercise (BitcoinAddressTest could be helpful)
        * using Secp256k1 object, derive public key (DER) from private key
            ```

            ```
        * encode public key in base64

* hex - base16
    * values: (0‚ÄìF)

    * values: A-Z, a-z, 0-9 (62 values) and +, /
* base58 - base64 without the 0, O, l, I, +, /
* sha256
    * cryptographic hash function that outputs a 256-bit (32-byte) number
* ripemd160
    * cryptographic hash function that outputs a 160-bit (20-byte) number

## keys, addresses
* string of digits and characters
* derived from public keys
    * algorithms used to make a bitcoin address from a public key: SHA256 and RIPEMD160
        * PKH = RIPEMD160(SHA256(PUBLIC_KEY))
        * PKH - public key hash
        * RIPEMD160 - deliberate choice to make the PKHs shorter
        * motivation of using two different hash functions
            * well-balanced trade-off between security and size
            * different roots
                * SHA256 - US National Security Agency (NSA)
                * RIPEMD160 - European university in open collaboration with a broad community
            * composite hash does not have a Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd structure
                * concern about possible weaknesses in the Merkle‚ÄìDamg√•rd structure itself
                    * example: length extension attack
                        * key idea
                            * the output of the hash function corresponds to its internal state
                            when it finishes processing the input
                            * we can resume the hashing and provide it extra input
                        * tool: https://github.com/bwall/HashPump
            * pre-image-resistant = is the property of a hash function that it is hard to invert
                * if either hash function turns out to not be pre-image-resistant, the other still is
                    * example
                        * if you can calculate an input to RIPEMD160 that gives a certain
                        PKH output, you still need to pre-image attack SHA256 to find the public key
                            * 2^255 guesses
                * first preimage attack
                * second preimage attack
            * however if the output set of either cryptographic hash function is smaller than
            anticipated => output set of combined hash-function is affected
                * pretend SHA256 has only 100 possible output values => Only 100 different PKHs
                * just try different random privateKey => use corresponding publicKey => calculate corresponding PKH
* represent the owner of a private/public key pair
    * or a payment script
* almost always encoded as "Base58Check" to help human readability
    * Base58Check = base58 plus checksum
        * checksum = additional four bytes
            * appended to the end
            * hashOfHash = SHA256(SHA256(prefix+data))
                * prefix example
                    * bitcoin address: zero (0x00 in hex)
                        * Base58 result prefix: 1
                    * private key: 128 (0x80 in hex)
                        * Base58 result prefix: 5, K, or L
            * checksum = first four bytes of hashOfHash

## elliptic curves
* elliptic curve visualisation
    * https://www.desmos.com/calculator/caabrmnwxq?lang=pl
* elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)
    * elliptic curves over the finite field ùîΩp (where p is prime and p > 3) or ùîΩ2^p (where p is prime)
        * field is a square matrix of size p x p
        * points on the curve are limited to integer coordinates within the field only
    * uses elliptic curves in a simplified form (Weierstras form)
        * Weierstrass form: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b, (a and b are real numbers)
        * example - Bitcoin curve
            * y^2 = x^3 + 7
            * p = 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 -2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1
* bouncy castle
    * to create public key in DER format we need
        ```
        SubjectPublicKeyInfoFactory.createSubjectPublicKeyInfo(publicKeyParams).getEncoded("DER")
        ```
    * publicKeyParams are created from a constructor
        ```
        public ECPublicKeyParameters(
            ECPoint             q, // point representing the public key
            ECDomainParameters  parameters) // domain parameters representing the curve
        ```
    * ECNamedDomainParameters = ASN1ObjectIdentifier (curve name) and ECDomainParameters (domainParameters)
        ```
        ECDomainParameters(
                ECCurve     curve,
                ECPoint     G,
                BigInteger  n,
                BigInteger  h)
        ```
* domain parameters
    * ECC elliptic curves are described by a set of elliptic curve domain parameters
        * example: curve equation parameters, the field parameters and the generator point coordinates
        * parameters are specified in cryptography standards
            * example: SEC 2: Recommended Elliptic Curve Domain Parameters
    * a,b,p define a curve (y^2 == x^3+a^x +b) mod p
        * "Bitcoin curve" secp256k1 takes the form: y2 ‚â° x3 + 7 (mod p)
    * n - order of the curve
        * total number of all EC points on the curve
        * includes also the special point called "point at infinity"
            * act as the group's neutral element
    * G - generation point
        * some curves form a single cyclic group
        * others form several non-overlapping cyclic subgroups
            * points on the curve are split into h cyclic subgroups
        * G can generate any other point in its subgroup by multiplying G by some integer in the range [0...r]
            * r - "order" of the cyclic subgroup (the total number of all points in the subgroup)
        * for curves with cofactor = 1 there is only one subgroup
    * h is the cofactor of G
        * points over an elliptic curve stay in one or several non-overlapping subsets, called cyclic subgroups
            * number of subgroups is called "cofactor"
        * if the curve consists of only one cyclic subgroup, its cofactor h = 1
            * example: secp256k1
        * if the curve consists of several subgroups, its cofactor > 1
            * example: Curve25519
                * cofactor = 8
